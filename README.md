# string_set
A C++ set-like container for string type

It is a self constructed std::set-like container for string by C++. Features:
1. Object-oriented programming. Class creating, copy constructor, move constructor, copy-assignment operator and move-assignment operator.
2. Memory management with alloc class, including memory allocatioin, using and deallocation.
3. In order to sort the set, heap sort is used for the container. Binary search is used for searching any element contained in the set. 

Future directions:
For now the container is still only for string type. Maybe in the future it can be extended to a general template container for more types. Besides, more methods can be added to the class.
